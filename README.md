RPN Calculator
I have implemented the RPN calculator, with a stack queue. 

Only Enter Integers.
Enter a number and press enter. This will insert the number into the stack and print it out immediately.
Enter a second number and the same thing happens, the stack will get printed.
Enter an operand.
The last two numbers get +,/,*,-, together and printed.

I have not implemented enoughâ€¦ almost any error messages.
