I had to make the two methods in seperat classes.

I made my Server in java it has two REST methods. I tested with postman, both methods work there.

MyCount.elm gets the gount (in the console) when you push Get Count.
Client.elm Will not allow me to put anything through the put method, I keep getting the acces-control-allow-header error.
